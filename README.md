## Summary
Study Tracker is a productivity recorder for students, specifically for their study sessions.
When students begin to feel bored, lose focus, or feel the desire to procrastinate during a study session, they press the 'Start Break' button on the app and can leave a short description. The app will log the time the break began.
When the student returns to their study session from their break, they press the 'End Break' button, which again logs the time.

With this app, students will be able to notice the patterns in their study sessions, such as when they start to lose focus, how long of a break they feel is necessary, and how productive they are after that duration of a break.

This analysis will be useful to students as they will be able to see data on their productivity when trying out different producitivity methods, and be able to identify which method works best for them.
